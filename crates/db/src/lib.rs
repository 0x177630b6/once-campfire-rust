//! Campfire's data layer: rusqlite over the Rails schema, with models that write rows
//! exactly as Active Record does and perform the same callback side effects in the same
//! transactions. See `plans/rust-conversion.md`, "Persisted data".
//!
//! Reads take a `&Connection` (a reader, or the writer inside a write). Writes take a
//! [`Tx`], which carries the clock, the [`EventSink`] for side effects that leave the
//! database, and the after-commit queue.
